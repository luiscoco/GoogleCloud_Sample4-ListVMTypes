# GoogleCloud_Sample4-ListVMTypes

This code demonstrates the use of the Google Cloud Compute API to list machine types in a specific project and zone. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The code starts by importing the necessary namespace Google.Cloud.Compute.V1, which provides classes and methods for interacting with the Google Cloud Compute service.
2. The MachineTypesClient and ImagesClient objects are instantiated using the Create() method. These clients allow communication with the Google Cloud Compute API to perform operations related to machine types and images, respectively.
3. Next, the code calls the List() method on the machineTypesClient object, passing in a ListMachineTypesRequest object. This request specifies the project and zone for which the machine types should be listed. In this case, the project is set to "focus-cache-387205" and the zone is set to "europe-southwest1-a".
4. The result of the List() method is stored in the machineTypesList variable, which represents a collection of machine types.
5. The code then uses a foreach loop to iterate over each MachineType object in the machineTypesList collection. Inside the loop, it prints the name of each machine type using Console.WriteLine(). The {machineType.Name} is a placeholder that gets replaced with the actual name of the machine type during each iteration.
6. After printing all the machine types, an empty line is printed using Console.WriteLine() to provide a visual separation.

This code demonstrates a basic example of how to use the Google Cloud Compute API to list machine types in a specific project and zone.

## Code

```csharp
using Google.Cloud.Compute.V1;

// Instantiate the MachineTypesClient and ImagesClient
MachineTypesClient machineTypesClient = MachineTypesClient.Create();
ImagesClient imagesClient = ImagesClient.Create();

// List machine types
var machineTypesList = machineTypesClient.List(new ListMachineTypesRequest
{
    Project = "XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    Zone = "europe-southwest1-a"
});

Console.WriteLine("Machine Types:");
foreach (MachineType machineType in machineTypesList)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"- {machineType.Name}");
}

Console.WriteLine();
```
